The following issues, problems, or missing features need a larger description
and are thus not contained in the "TODO.txt" file:
\begin{description}
 \item[Code reordering around transaction begin end] There are some reasons
why this could be a problem, and there are reasons why it probably isn't a
problem. This needs more work. Aspects of this problem are (1)
correctness when rolling back data on the stack, (2) whether this can violate
the semantics of transactions especially when using transactions for error
handling, and (3) potential performance gains of reordering and moving
code into or out of transactions (which is strongly related to (2)).
