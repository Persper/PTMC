TMLINK
=======
tmlink is a linker that makes it easier to use Tanger. It (1) links all
compiled object files into a single LLVM bitcode module, (2) runs TM
transformations on this module, (3) links the STM core and support
libraries, (4) and compiles the resulting bitcode to native code.


INSTALLATION
============
tmlink is built automatically when Tanger is built.

USAGE
=====
To use tmlink several arguments have to be provided.
-stmlib=<string>       - path to libtanger-stm.bc
-stmsupport=<string>   - path to stmsupport.bc library
-tanger=<string>       - path to libtanger.so file (the LLVM pass)
-tanger-arg=<string>   - additional arguments for tanger

-L=<string>            - Search path for library
-l=<string>            - Add library when linking
-g                     - enable debug information (disables optimizations)
-o=<file>              - Output file name

Use tmlink --help to refer to more information.

tmlink inputfiles -o outputfile

Thats all.
